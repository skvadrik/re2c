Release 4.4
===========

This release adds generalized end-of-input symbol ``$``.
It is no longer a special rule -- it can be used in regular expressions as
part of a normal rule, and it works with all end-of-input handling methods
regardless of the ``re2c:eof`` configuration.

The implementation of generalized end-of-input symbol ``$`` is based on a new
API primitive ``YYEND`` and the corresponding syntax configuration
``code:yyend``. The meaning of ``YYEND`` is the *logical* end of input. This
differs from the *physical* end of input described by ``YYLIMIT`` and
``YYLESSTHAN`` -- the latter may include padding that was not part of the
original input. If ``YYFILL`` is disabled, ``code:yyend`` has a default
definition identical to ``YYLESSTHAN``, so the user does not need to explicitly
define ``YYEND``. Otherwise, if ``YYFILL`` is enabled, ``code:yyend`` does not
provide a default definition and delegates to the user-defined ``YYEND``.

This change breaks backwards compatibility in cases when there are conflicting
``$`` rules, as they now have position-based precedence like other normal rules.
Hopefully such cases are rare, and the users have been alerted by the
``-Wdeprecated-eof-rule`` warning in release 4.3.

See the changelog: :ref:`releases/changelog/changelog:4.4 (2025-12-20)`.

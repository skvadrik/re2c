DESCRIPTION
-----------

re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C, C++ and Go.

Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably
optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven
approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form
of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and
often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to
debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed
up and compress the generated code.

Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a
fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface
code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.

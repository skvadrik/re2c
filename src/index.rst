*re2c* stands for *Regular Expressions to Code*.
It is a free and open-source lexer generator that supports C/C++, D, Go,
Haskell, Java, JavaScript, OCaml, Python, Rust, V, Zig, and can be extended to
other languages by implementing a single :ref:`syntax file <manual/manual_c:syntax files>`.
The primary focus of re2c is on generating *fast* code: it compiles regular
expressions to deterministic finite automata and translates them into
direct-coded lexers in the target language (such lexers are generally faster
and easier to debug than their table-driven analogues).
Secondary re2c focus is on *flexibility*: it does not assume a fixed program
template; instead, it allows the user to embed lexers anywhere in the source
code and configure them to avoid unnecessary buffering and bounds checks.
Internal algorithm used by re2c is based on a special kind of deterministic
finite automata: `lookahead TDFA <2022_borsotti_trofimovich_a_closer_look_at_tdfa.pdf>`_.
These automata are as fast as ordinary DFA, but they are also capable of
performing submatch extraction with minimal overhead.
re2c is used in other open-source projects, such as
`php <http://php.net/>`_,
`ninja <https://ninja-build.org/>`_,
`yasm <http://yasm.tortall.net/>`_,
`spamassassin <https://spamassassin.apache.org/>`_,
`BRL-CAD <http://brlcad.org/>`_,
`wake <https://github.com/sifive/wake>`_,
etc.

Authors
-------

re2c was originally written by Peter Bumbulis (peter@csg.uwaterloo.ca) in 1993.
Marcus Boerger and Dan Nuffer spent several years to turn the original idea into
a production ready code generator. Since then it has been maintained and
developed by multiple volunteers, most notably,
Brian Young (bayoung@acm.org),
`Marcus Boerger <https://github.com/helly25>`_,
Dan Nuffer (nuffer@users.sourceforge.net),
`Ulya Trofimovich <https://github.com/skvadrik>`_ (skvadrik@gmail.com),
`Serghei Iakovlev <https://github.com/sergeyklay>`_,
`Sergei Trofimovich <https://github.com/trofi>`_,
`Petr Skocik <https://github.com/pskocik>`_,
`ligfx <https://github.com/ligfx>`_
and `raekye <https://github.com/raekye>`_.
Many thanks to all other contributors!

re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C/C++, Go and Rust with a
focus on generating fast code. It compiles regular expression specifications to
deterministic finite automata and encodes them in the form of conditional jumps
in the target language. This approach is generally faster than table-based
lexers, and the generated code is easier to debug and understand. A flexible
user interface allows one to adapt the generated lexer to a particular
environment and input model, avoiding the overhead on unnecessary checks and
buffers. re2c is based on the
`lookahead TDFA <2022_borsotti_trofimovich_a_closer_look_at_tdfa.pdf>`_
algorithm that allows it to perform fast and lightweight submatch extraction.
It is used in other open-source projects such as
`php <http://php.net/>`_,
`ninja <https://ninja-build.org/>`_,
`yasm <http://yasm.tortall.net/>`_,
`spamassassin <https://spamassassin.apache.org/>`_,
`BRL-CAD <http://brlcad.org/>`_,
`wake <https://github.com/sifive/wake>`_,
etc.

Download
--------

You can get the
`latest release <https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/releases/latest>`_ on GitHub,
as well as the `older releases <https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/releases>`_.
Many Linux distributions and other systems provide their own packages. The
source code is hosted on both GitHub (`<https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c>`_) and
SourceForge (`<https://sourceforge.net/p/re2c>`_). GitHub serves as the main
repository, bugtracker and tarball hosting. SourceForge is used as a backup
repository and email hosting.

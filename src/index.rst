re2c is a lexer generator for C/C++.
Its key features are:

*   Very fast lexers: the generated code is as good as a carefully tuned, hand-crafted C/C++ lexer.
    This is because re2c generates minimalistic, hard-coded state machines
    (as opposed to full-featured table-based lexers).

*   Flexible API: one can `configure <manual/syntax/syntax.html#configurations>`_
    or even `completely override <manual/features/generic_api/generic_api.html>`_
    the way re2c generates code.
    Programmers can adjust their lexer to a particular input model,
    avoid unnecessary overhead (drop useless runtime checks, do in-place lexing, etc.),
    and make all sorts of hacks.
    The `examples <examples/examples.html>`_ cover many real-world cases and shed some light on the dark corners of the re2c API.

*   Efficient `Unicode support <manual/features/encodings/encodings.html>`_
    (code points are compiled into executable finite-state machines).

*   `Warnings <manual/warnings/warnings.html>`_.

*   `Autogenerated tests <manual/features/skeleton/skeleton.html>`_ with very good coverage.

*   `License <about/about.html>`_ (public domain).



Bugs & feedback
---------------

Please send feedback to `re2c-devel <re2c-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>`_ and
the `re2c-general <re2c-general@lists.sourceforge.net>`_ mailing lists
(search `mail archives <https://sourceforge.net/p/re2c/mailman/>`_ for old threads),
or `report a bug <https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/issues>`_.

Note that re2c is hosted on both `github <https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c>`_
and `sourceforge <https://sourceforge.net/p/re2c>`_ for redundancy.
Currently, github serves as the main repository, bugtracker, and hosting site for binaries.
Sourceforge is used as a backup repository and for mail
(so please don't send your bugreports or feedback to sourceforge).

Contribute
----------

Contributions come in various forms:

* Tests: a very easy and valuable way of contributing is by adding your lexer to the re2c test suite.
  Real-world tests are the best.
  Feel free to strip out all non-re2c code if you must keep it secret.
  In return, re2c will not break your code (re2c developers strive to never break existing tests).

* Ideas: new features and new ways to use re2c.

* Development: bugfixes, features, and ports to other languages.

Everyone is welcome!

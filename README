If you modify the website layout (directory structure), be sure to fix all links
(including links on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re2c).

To update website http://re2c.org, on gh-pages-gen:

- Install extra prerequisites. For Ubuntu 22.04 the following packages need to be installed via apt-get
  * pdf2svg
  * texlive-full (beware of the bug during installation: https://askubuntu.com/questions/956006/pregenerating-context-markiv-format-this-may-take-some-time-takes-forever)
  * python3-sphinx
  * cmake
  * ninja-build

- Run ./sync_with_branch.sh to sync with master branch that contains the core
  documentation used to generate manpage and help message. Commit.

- Edit sources. Test changes on localhost using ./make.sh (with no arguments it
  builds and launches the website on localhost:8000). Reiterate. Commit.

- Push changes (still on gh-pages-gen, does not affect re2c.org).

- Run ./push_website.sh (it will wipe out obj/ and re2c.org/ subdirectories,
  run ./make.sh with an argument to prevent launching, copy the new obj/ to
  re2c.org/, init a git repository there and set upstream to gh-pages branch,
  then commit and push). This will publish the new website (it will be updated
  once the corresponding GitHub action completes, see the
  https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/actions dashboard).

<h1>Release 1.0<a class="headerlink" href="#release-1-0" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This release is an important milestone in the history of re2c: it adds <em>submatch extraction</em>.
It is a long-awaited feature; even as Peter Bumbulis released the first version of re2c back in 1993,
he mentioned submatch extraction in his paper together with Donald D. Cowan
<a class="reference external" href="../../1994_bumbulis_cowan_re2c_a_more_versatile_scanner_generator.ps">“RE2C: a more versatile scanner generator”</a>
as a useful feature that soon should be added to re2c.
It seemed back then that submatch extraction is relatively easy to implement;
like many other useful extensions, it was deemed to be no more than syntactic sugar on top of canonical regular expressions.</p>
<p>As it turned out, this is not so:
the problem of <em>parsing</em> with regular expressions is inherently more complex than <em>recognition</em>,
and submatch extraction cannot be implemented using traditional DFA-based approach.
Many authors studied this subject and developed algorithms suitable for their particular settings and problem domains.
Some of them used NFA-based approach,
others suggested algorithms based on multiple DFA or multiple passes over a single DFA.
For re2c most of these algorithms are too heavyweight:
they require complication of the underlying computational model and incur overhead even in simple cases.</p>
<p>However, one algorithm is outstanding in this respect:
it is the algorithm invented by Ville Laurikari in 2000 and described in his paper
<a class="reference external" href="http://laurikari.net/ville/spire2000-tnfa.pdf">“NFAs with Tagged Transitions, their Conversion to Deterministic Automata and Application to Regular Expressions”</a>.
Laurikari algorithm is based on a single DFA extended with a fixed number of <em>registers</em>; it makes one pass over the input string,
works in linear time and the required space does not depend on the input length.
But what is most important, the added complexity depends on submatch detalization:
on submatch-free regular expressions Laurikari automaton reduces to a simple DFA.</p>
<p>When the work on submatch extraction feature started in early 2016,
at first it seemed that Laurikari algorithm was still overly complicated.
Re2c needed an algorithm that would support only <em>partial</em> submatch extraction,
but the supported cases would be handled very efficiently.
A lot of effort was spent on studying papers,
and finally this lead to the development of a new algorithm.
It soon became clear that the self-invented algorithm was in fact a special case of Laurikari algorithm,
with one significant performance improvement: the use of lookahead symbol.
Surprisingly, the original Laurikari algorithm has a strange deficiency:
when recording submatches, the automata totally ignore the lookahead symbol
and perform a lot of redundant operations that could be easily avoided.
It was only logical to fix Laurikari algorithm.
The new improved algorithm is described in the paper
<a class="reference external" href="../../2017_trofimovich_tagged_deterministic_finite_automata_with_lookahead.pdf">“Tagged Deterministic Finite Automata with Lookahead”</a></p>
<p>Submatch extraction in re2c comes in two flavors:
POSIX-compliant capturing groups (with true POSIX semantics)
and standalone <em>tags</em> that use leftmost greedy disambiguation.
Both features require a number of new API primitives and configurations;
and they are barely documented yet (though I managed to add a section in the manual).
The paper cited above has some interesting benchmark results;
articles and examples will follow in the nearest future.
As usually, you may expect a number of small bug-fix releases in the 1.0.x series.</p>
<p>The following people contributed to this release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Petr Skocik tidied up re2c documentation: fixed ubiquitous spelling errors
and established synchronization system between the online documentation,
manpage and help message displayed by re2c with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--help</span></code> option.</p></li>
<li><p>Sergei Trofimovich wrote a <em>fuzzer</em> that generates random regular expressions
and checks them on input data generated with re2c <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--skeleton</span></code> option.
This fuzzer is most helpful; it has already found tens of bugs in the early implementation of submatch extraction.
Sergei also helped me with testing re2c on numerous platforms and computer architectures.</p></li>

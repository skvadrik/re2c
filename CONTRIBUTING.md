[re2c][re2c] was written in 1993 by Peter Bumbulis. Since then it has been
maintained and developed by multiple volunteers. Contributions are welcome,
please have a look at the guidelines below.

## Contributions

The preferred form of a contribution is a pull request on GitHub. Patches sent
by email are also fine (but less convenient). Discussion in
[GitHub issues][issues] is welcome. Email threads are also fine (but less
convenient).

## Language guidelines

re2c is written in C++ (the current standard is C++11). The algorithms and
mathematical concepts used in the code are quite complex, so the code itself
should stay simple and let the developer focus on the underlying logic, without
the language getting in the way. For example, try to avoid complex object
hierarchies and excessive use of template metaprogramming.

The line length limit is 100 characters, indentation is 4 spaces, and the
indentation style is egyptian (the opening brace is on the same line). This is
the approximate `astyle` command to auto-format re2c source code (it requires
manual tweaking for argument/initializer lists and multiline comments):

    $ # run in source directory
    $ astyle --style=google \
             --max-code-length=100 \
             --align-pointer=type \
             --align-reference=type \
             --keep-one-line-statements \
             --suffix=none \
             --recursive '*'

## Regenerating bootstrap files

By default re2c uses bootstrap files for autogenerated sources (lexers, parsers,
docs) and does not attempt to regenerate them. Developers may need to enable
"regeneration mode" if they modify the corresponding source files.

For changes that affect lexers (`.re` files), regeneration mode is configured
with options `--enable-lexers` (Autotools) or `-DRE2C_REBUILD_LEXERS=ON`
(CMake). `RE2C_FOR_BUILD` should be defined as a path to an existing re2c
executable that will be used to regenerate the lexers.

For changes that affect parsers (`.ypp` files), regeneration mode is configured
with options `--enable-parsers` (Autotools) or `-DRE2C_REBUILD_PARSERS=ON`
(CMake). In this case `bison` must be installed on the system. Otherwise
Autoconf or CMake will fail at configuration stage.

For changes that update documentation, it is necessary to rebuild the bootstrap
manpages by reconfiguring and rebuilding re2c with options `--enable-docs`
(Autotools) or `-DRE2C_REBUILD_DOCS=ON` (CMake).

Please do not commit trivial updates to the bootstrap files, such as changes of
the generator version or generation date.

## Commit messages

The headline should use present tense and start with a capital letter. Commit
messages should be as descriptive as possible and avoid uncertain terms like
"fix", "refactoring", "code cleanup" and so on. Long commit messages with
explanations, examples and test instructions are welcome.

Unrelated changes should be split into multiple commits.

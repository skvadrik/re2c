ReTdfa is a Java library and benchmark for regular expression parsing
and submatch extraction. It contains a family of algorithms based on
TNFA and TDFA. It also contains a benchmark for various algorithms,
including libre2c.

ReTdfa is developed by Angelo Borsotti. The code here is a copy of the
original (slightly modified), and may be out of date.

Note: to rerun the benchmark, remove the autogenerated measure*.ser
files (otherwise ReTdfa will only regenerate the charts).

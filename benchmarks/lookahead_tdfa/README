To run benchmarks:

1. Create symlink to the RE2C binary (version 1.0 or older) in the current
directory.

2. Generate input data: files ./http/gen/http.dat and ./uri/gen/uri.dat.
    Random data can be generated with the following programs (written in
    haskell):

        http/gen/gen_http.hs
        uri/gen/gen_uri.hs

    Use the following scripts to build generators:

        http/gen/mk_gen.sh
        uri/gen/mk_gen.sh

    The size of the generated data is hard-coded in the source code of
    generators (and can be easily tweaked).

    Alternatively, if you don't have haskell compiler or for any other reason
    are unable to build generators, use small data samples provided for each
    benchmark (one can copy-paste them many times with 'cat' to obtain a large
    input file):

        http/gen/sample.dat
        uri/gen/sample.dat

3.Run scripts:
    ./http/simple/__bench.sh
    ./http/simple/__bench_b.sh
    ./http/simple/__bench_unopt.sh
    ./http/rfc7230/__bench.sh
    ./http/rfc7230/__bench_b.sh
    ./http/rfc7230/__bench_unopt.sh
    ./uri/simple/__bench.sh
    ./uri/simple/__bench_b.sh
    ./uri/simple/__bench_unopt.sh
    ./uri/rfc3986/__bench.sh
    ./uri/rfc3986/__bench_b.sh
    ./uri/rfc3986/__bench_unopt.sh

    Alternatively, run ./__run.sh (it will drop logs in each subdirectory).
